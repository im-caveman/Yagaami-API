# Yagaami-API | Job Listing Aggregator API Solution
A scalable, cost-effective job listing aggregator that meets your requirements while avoiding rate limits and high costs. Let's break this down into components:

## Architecture Overview
We'll create a distributed system that:
1. Scrapes job listings from multiple sources
2. Normalizes the data
3. Stores it in a searchable database
4. Exposes it through RESTful API endpoints

## Data Sources
Instead of relying on expensive APIs like JSearch, we'll:
- Directly scrape major job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor)
- Utilize RSS feeds from company career pages
- Leverage public job board APIs with generous free tiers
- Implement company career page scrapers for targeted companies

# Technical Componenets
Let's create the core components:

# 1. Scraper Service
The scraper service will:
- Use a rotating proxy pool to avoid IP blocks
- Implement different scraping strategies per source
- Queue and distribute scraping tasks to avoid overwhelming any single source
- Cache results to minimize duplicate requests


# 2. Data Storage
We'll use:
1. PostgreSQL for structured data with PostGIS extension for location-based searches
2. Elasticsearch for fast full-text search capabilities
3. Redis for caching frequent queries and rate limiting

# 3. API Implementation
Let's implement the core API endpoints:  [here](https://github.com/im-caveman/Yagaami-API/blob/75dfb435187f690a908e8bce67af41fc348ebc26/Yagaami%20API%20Implementation.py)

# Data Collection Strategies
## 1. Scraper Implementation
Let's create a scraper module that handles different job sources:
