# Yagaami-API | Job Listing Aggregator API Solution
A scalable, cost-effective job listing aggregator that meets your requirements while avoiding rate limits and high costs. Let's break this down into components:

## Architecture Overview
We'll create a distributed system that:
1. Scrapes job listings from multiple sources
2. Normalizes the data
3. Stores it in a searchable database
4. Exposes it through RESTful API endpoints

## Data Sources
Instead of relying on expensive APIs like JSearch, we'll:
- Directly scrape major job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor)
- Utilize RSS feeds from company career pages
- Leverage public job board APIs with generous free tiers
- Implement company career page scrapers for targeted companies
